Part 2: 

**Branch** -  a copy of a codeline, managed in a version control system (VCS).

**Clone** - allows programmers to copy the values of an object or source code of an application program to another without the need for writing the explicit code.

**Commit** - Git commit are changes to an individual file or multiple files. It allows you to keep track of all the changes that are made.

**Fetch** -  a new native JavaScript API, supported by most browsers today. Fetch allows you to make network requests similar to XMLHttpRequest . 

**GIT** - is the version control system (VCS) we use to keep control of the changes of our files, while GitHub is a service we use to store our project files and their Git history online.

**Github** - is a web-based version-control and collaboration platform for software developers.

**Merge** - is the process of combining the various versions of a file or folder. This feature is typically found in version control software as a fundamental operation that is responsible for reconciliation of changes of data in a file.

**Merge Conflict** - happen when you merge branches that have competing commits, and Git needs your help to decide which changes to incorporate in the final merge.

**Push** - the delivery of information on the Web that is initiated by the information server rather than by the information user or client , as it usually is.

**Pull** - a style of network communication where the initial request for data originates from the client, and then is responded to by the server.

**Remote** - is what I call it when a single anchor link has multiple clickable areas in different locations.

**Repository** - is a place that hosts an application's code source, together with various metadata.
